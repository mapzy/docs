# Adding a location

We're trying to implement the WYSIWYG ("What You See Is What You Get") approach as often as possible. Therefore, when you sign in to your dashboard, you see your map just like your visitors will see it. To add a location, just click on the "Add Location" button at the bottom of the screen and fill out the information. Here's a video showing the process:

  Your browser does not support the video tag.

## Adjusting the marker

After entering an address, the marker should show up on the correct location on the map. Sometimes it might be a couple of meters off. To remedy that, just click on "Need to adjust the marker?" and drag it to the correct location. Note that this doesn't change the street address that's displayed for this location.
