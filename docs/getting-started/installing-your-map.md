# Installing your map

Once you have added some locations to your map and are ready to add it to your website, click on "Install map" in the top menu. This will display a so-called iframe embed code. It will look something like this, only with a different URL that references your map:

```html
<iframe src="https://app.mapzy.io/maps/m5PHzy" allow="geolocation"
  title="Map by mapzy.io" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"
  height="600px" width="100%">
</iframe> 
```

This is just a simple piece of HTML code. You can copy and paste into any website that allows displaying HTML code and your map will show up.

There are few ways to customize this HTML snippet that will change how your map will be displayed or behave. You can learn more about them in our [dedicated section](/embedding-options/height-and-width).

You can learn more about how iframes work from the excellent [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe).
